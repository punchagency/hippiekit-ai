________________________________________
1. Quats (Expanded)
You already listed "Quaternary Ammonium Compounds (Quats)" under feminine care — but they’re also rampant in disinfectants, fabric softeners, and hair products.
•	Examples to add: Benzalkonium chloride (you already have), Cetrimonium chloride, Stearalkonium chloride
2. Chelating Agents (EDTA family)
Used in cleaning + personal care to bind minerals.
•	Disodium EDTA, Tetrasodium EDTA, HEDTA
These aren’t always toxic but are worth flagging for their link to skin irritation and environmental persistence.
3. Polymers + Film Formers
Especially in cosmetics, sunscreen, haircare:
•	Acrylamide Copolymer, VP/VA Copolymer, Carbomer, Polyquaterniums
They’re plastic-based, often unlabeled as such, and degrade into microplastic-like fragments.
4. Preservative Expansions
Already very solid — but here are a few borderline ones you could add if you want to go full watchdog:
•	Caprylyl Glycol
•	Ethylhexylglycerin
•	Chlorphenesin
These are used in “clean” beauty brands as alternatives to parabens but can still be irritants and often work alongside other preservatives.
5. Emulsifiers / Solubilizers (in Flavors + Skincare)
•	Polysorbate 80 (you already have it in surfactants)
•	PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil
•	Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (sometimes plant-based, but often overprocessed)
6. Industrial Bleaches Not Yet Listed
You already have benzoyl peroxide and chlorine dioxide in food processing — consider adding:
•	Hydrogen Peroxide (used in some “clean” dental and cosmetic products)
•	Peracetic Acid (already on your produce list — good!)
7. Misc. “Natural” Greenwashing Ingredients
These sound clean but are often greenwashed or misleading:
•	Phenethyl Alcohol (natural-sounding fragrance fixative)
•	Lauroyl Lysine (can be petroleum-derived)
•	Cocamide DEA/MEA (you flagged Cocamidopropyl Betaine, but not these)
8. Smoke Flavor Additives in Food
•	Liquid Smoke, Smoke Flavor, Mesquite Extract
Not toxic per se, but often contain PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) which are potential carcinogens.
9. Enzyme Cleaners (Potential Sensitizers)
•	Protease, Amylase, Lipase, Cellulase
Often found in laundry and dishwashing products labeled as “natural” — can cause respiratory or skin issues.
